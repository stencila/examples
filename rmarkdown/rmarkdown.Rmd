# Preface

This article describes how to write a reproducible research using R Markdown and Stencila. It is part of a series of "self-documenting" articles, each written in a particular format, describing how to author articles in the format

# Introduction

# Code chunks

```{r}
randoms <- rnorm(1000)
```

```{r}
hist(randoms, breaks=30, col="grey", main="")
```

# Inline code chunks

In R Markdown you can also inline "inline" code chunks within paragraphs and other text content. For example, here is the mean of the `randoms` variable that we assigned earlier: `r mean(randoms)`. In Stencila, we call these `CodeExpression`s, because they are intended to display a calculated value, and shouldn't be used for statements, such as assigning a variable.
