## Word

This example describes how to write reproducible articles using Microsoft Word and Stencila.  
 
You can read it on Stencila using this button,

At present Stencila does not support creating a reproducible article in Word; you have to write it first in another format and then convert it to Word. This example is written using Markdown in `word.md` and then converted to `word.docx` using:
 
```bash 
stencila convert word.md word.docx
```
